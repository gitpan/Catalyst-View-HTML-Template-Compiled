DESCRIPTION
    This is the C<HTML::Template::Compiled> view class. Your subclass should inherit from this
    class.

METHODS
    process
        Renders the template specified in $c->stash->{template}, $c->request->match,
        $c->config->{template}->{filename} or __PACKAGE__->config->{filename}.
        Template params are set up from the contents of $c->stash,
        augmented with *base* set to $c->req->base and *name* to
        $c->config->{name}.  Output is stored in $c->response->body.

    config
        This allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to the
        HTML::Template config hash.
