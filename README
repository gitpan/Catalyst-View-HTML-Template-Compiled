DESCRIPTION
    This is the "HTML::Template::Compiled" view class. Your subclass should
    inherit from this class.

METHODS
    process
        Renders the template specified in *$c->stash->{template}*,
        *$c->request->match*, *$c->config->{template}->{filename}* or
        *__PACKAGE__->config->{filename}*.

        Template params are set up from the contents of *$c->stash*,
        augmented with "base" set to *$c->req->base*, *name* to
        *$c->config->{name}* and *c* to *$c*. Output is stored in
        *$c->response->body*.

    config
        "use_default_path": if set, will include *$c->config->{root}* and
        *$c->config->{root} . '/base'* to look for the template. *Defaults
        to 1*.

        This also allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to
        the "HTML::Template::Compiled" config hash.
