DESCRIPTION
    This is the " HTML::Template::Compiled " view class. Your subclass
    should inherit from this class.

METHODS
    new Internally used by "Catalyst". Used to configure some internal
        stuff.

    process
        Renders the template specified in * $c-*stash->{template} >, *
        $c-*request->match >, * $c-*config->{template}->{filename} > or *
        __PACKAGE__-*config->{filename} >.

        Template params are set up from the contents of * $c-*stash >,
        augmented with " base " set to * $c-*req->base >, * name * to *
        $c-*config->{name} > and * c * to * $c *. Output is stored in *
        $c-*response->body >.

    prepare_process
        Pretty much the first thing called by * process *. Only used for
        sub-classing. Return a i<true>-value if everything is okay,
        otherwise * process * will fail.

    finalize_process
        Will be called right before * process * finishes. Only used for
        sub-classing. Whatever it returns, * process * will return.

    prepare_htc
        Creates the " HTML::Template::Compiled " object. On success, returns
        the filename to be rendered; undef otherwise.

    htc Accessor to the "HTML::Template::Compiled" object. May returns undef
        then the object has not yet been created or creating has failed.

    prepare_render
        First thing before " render " is called. Assigns the parameters like
        the ones from the stash.

    render
        This is where the rendering magic happens. Returns the rendered
        output on success, or undef otherwise.

    template
        Tries to find the right template to render. Returns its filename or
        undef. Actually only used internally.

    path
        Returns a array ref with paths used to find the templates in.

    config
        "use_default_path": if set, will include *$c->config->{root}* and
        *$c->config->{root} . '/base'* to look for the template. *Defaults
        to 1*.

        This also allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to
        the "HTML::Template::Compiled" config hash.

    config_names
        A list of names that are used to locate configuration parameters for
        the view inside " $c-"config >.

    catalyst
        Normally all methods are called with the * $c * as the first
        parameter. Just to insure that you have it as a method it case you
        need it. :) Will be initializes by " new ".
